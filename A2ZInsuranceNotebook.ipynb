    "## General Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding new customers is vital in every industry. The process for finding new\n",
    "customers begins by learning as much as possible from the existing customers.\n",
    "Understanding current customers allow organizations to identify groups of\n",
    "customers that have different product interests, different market\n",
    "participation, or different response to marketing efforts. With this, we will\n",
    "be able not only to serve better our customers, but also to improve the\n",
    "targeting of prospective customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market segmentation, the process of identifying customers’ groups, makes use\n",
    "of geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral characteristics of\n",
    "customers. By understanding the differences between the different segments,\n",
    "organizations can make better strategic choices about opportunities, product\n",
    "definition, positioning, promotions, pricing, and target marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Situation\n",
    "\n",
    "A2Z Insurance (A2Z) is a portuguese long standing insurance company that\n",
    "serves a wide array of insurance services: Motor, Household, Health, Life and\n",
    "Work Compensation. Although A2Z primarily serves portuguese customers, a\n",
    "significant portion of their customer acquisition comes from their web site.\n",
    "Customers can sign up to A2Z services through their branches, by telephone, or\n",
    "on the web site.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, A2Z became one of the largest insurers in Portugal. However, the lack\n",
    "of a data driven culture in the company ultimately led to poorly maintained\n",
    "databases over the years. A2Z is trying to make better use of the database it\n",
    "has regarding its customers. So far, it has simply mass-marketed everything.\n",
    "All potential and existing customers get the same promotions, and there are no\n",
    "attempts to identify target markets for cross-selling opportunities. Now, A2Z\n",
    "wants start differentiating customers, and developing more focused programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A2Z provided you an ABT (Analytic Based Table) with data regarding a sample of\n",
    "10.290 Customers from its active database. These are customers that had at\n",
    "least one insurance service with the company at the time the dataset was\n",
    "extracted. Your job is to segment the database and find the relevant clusters\n",
    "of customers. To do this, we suggest you segment the customers using different\n",
    "perspectives and approaches, as well as combine and analyze the results. A2Z\n",
    "would like to understand the value and demographics of each customer segment,\n",
    "as well as understand which types of insurance they will be more interested in\n",
    "buying.\n",
